 This algorithm passed the first two datasets and scored me 16 points! The coded solution is rather simple.
 
## My Layman's Terms

This algorithm counts the cost (money value) assoicated with certain patterns of substrings within a string.
Strings are some combinations of C's and J's like "CJJCCC", "JCJCCCCJJJ", but with a few '?' which could represent a C or a J.
There is a cost for every "CJ" you see, and a cost for every "JC" you see in the string.
Find the minimum costs of the strings with '?' in them.

Say the cost of "CJ" is $5, and the cost of "JC" is $7:

If the string was "CCCC?CCCC", obviously you'd want to replace the '?' with a C so you encounter no cost. If you replaced it with a 'J' you'd 
have to pay for one "CJ" and one "JC" so the cost would be 5+7=$12

Finding the minimum cost, you can actually just remove all the ? and count the original cost, this will be the same as the minimum.

This makes the code rather simple, though I did not solve the last "Additional Sample - Test Set 3".

## Problem Defined By Google

Cody-Jamal is working on his latest piece of abstract art: a mural consisting of a row of waning moons and closed umbrellas. Unfortunately, greedy copyright trolls are claiming that waning moons look like an uppercase C and closed umbrellas look like a J, and they have a copyright on CJ and JC. Therefore, for each time CJ appears in the mural, Cody-Jamal must pay X, and for each time JC appears in the mural, he must pay Y.

Cody-Jamal is unwilling to let them compromise his art, so he will not change anything already painted. He decided, however, that the empty spaces he still has could be filled strategically, to minimize the copyright expenses.

For example, if CJ?CC? represents the current state of the mural, with C representing a waning moon, J representing a closed umbrella, and ? representing a space that still needs to be painted with either a waning moon or a closed umbrella, he could finish the mural as CJCCCC, CJCCCJ, CJJCCC, or CJJCCJ. The first and third options would require paying X+Y in copyrights, while the second and fourth would require paying 2⋅X+Y.

Given the costs X and Y and a string representing the current state of the mural, how much does Cody-Jamal need to pay in copyrights if he finishes his mural in a way that minimizes that cost?

### Input
The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each line contains two integers X and Y and a string S representing the two costs and the current state of the mural, respectively.

### Output
For each test case, output one line containing Case #x: y, where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is the minimum cost that Cody-Jamal needs to pay in copyrights for a finished mural.

### Limits
Time limit: 10 seconds.
Memory limit: 1 GB.
**1≤T≤100.**
Each character of **S** is either C, J, or ?.

#### Test Set 1 (Visible Verdict)
1≤ the length of S ≤10.
1≤X≤100.
1≤Y≤100.

#### Test Set 2 (Visible Verdict)
1≤ the length of S ≤1000.
1≤X≤100.
1≤Y≤100.

### Extra credit!
What if some copyright holders could pay Cody-Jamal for the advertisement instead of being paid? Cody-Jamal getting paid is represented by a negative cost.

#### Test Set 3 (Hidden Verdict)
1≤ the length of S ≤1000.
−100≤X≤100.
−100≤Y≤100.

### Sample
Note: there are additional samples that are not run on submissions down below.
#### Sample Input
```bash
4
2 3 CJ?CC?
4 2 CJCJ
1 3 C?J
2 5 ??J???
```

#### Sample Output
```bash
Case #1: 5
Case #2: 10
Case #3: 1
Case #4: 0
```

Sample Case #1 is the one explained in the problem statement. The minimum cost is X+Y=2+3=5.

In Sample Case #2, Cody-Jamal is already finished, so he does not have a choice. There are two CJs and one JC in his mural.

In Sample Case #3, substituting either C or J results in one CJ either from the second and third characters or the first and second characters, respectively.

In Sample Case #4, Cody-Jamal can finish his mural with all Js. Since that contains no instance of CJ nor JC, it yields no copyright cost.


### Additional Sample - Test Set 3
The following additional sample fits the limits of Test Set 3. It will not be run against your submitted solutions.
#### Sample Input
```bash
1
2 -5 ??JJ??
```

#### Sample Output
``` bash
Case #1: -8
```

In Sample Case #1 for Test Set 3, Cody-Jamal can finish his mural optimally as JCJJCC or JCJJJC. Either way, there is one CJ and two JCs in his mural.
