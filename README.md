# GoogleCodeJam2021
My code from participating in the [Google Code Jam 2021](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam). 

It had been several years since I've participated in Code Jam, or even coded at all... but this ended up being a fun learning experience. It was also satisfying to 'crack the code'
to get the tests to pass and earn enough points to move on.

## [Qualification Round - March 26th, 2021](Qualification_Round)

The qualification round was open for 30 hours and was comprised of 5 problems. You needed to gain at least 30 points to move on.

Find my code and descriptions of the problems in the [Qualification Round Folder](Qualification_Round)

## [Round 1A - April 9th, 2021](Round_1A)

There were 3 problems and 2.5 hours to complete them. I went down the path of no return with question 1 and scored 0 points. *whomp whomp*

I will include my code that didn't work and the eventual solution that did.

## [Round 1B - April 25th, 11:00 AM CST, 2021](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/codejam/schedule)

I will try my luck again with round 1B.
